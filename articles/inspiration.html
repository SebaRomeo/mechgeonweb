                    I always was a fan of the <b>rpg games</b> and the <b>rogue likes</b>. I like the feeling of every new character that I create will be <b>unique</b>, 
                    this combined with the randomness of the roguelikes is what I want for <b>Mech-Geon</b>.
                    Here are some games that I took as reference for mechanics.
                </p>
                <img src="../resources/images/references/divinityReference.jpg" alt="">
                <p><i>Divinity Original Sin 2</i></span>
                <p>I love how in this game <b>everything</b> can interact with <b>everything</b>, allowing the player to create a lot of solutions for the same problem.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="../resources/images/references/isaacReference.jpg" alt="">
                <p><i>The Binding of Isaac</i></span>
                <p>Speaking about unique, similar to divinity, this game gives to the player tha ability to <b>combine every item</b> to each other in the game, but all the items are <b>random</b>,
                    so each run will be different to the other.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="../resources/images/references/xcomReference.jpg" alt="">
                <p><i>XCOM</i></span>
                <p>
                    For <b>Mech-Geon</b> I want a <b>grid-based combat</b>, very similar to <b>XCOM</b> but with only one character insted of a squad.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="../resources/images/references/monsterLabReference.jpg" alt="">
                <p><i>Monster Lab</i></span>
                <p>Last but not least, I played this game when I was a child and I loved it. <b>You build your monster</b> and the parts that you use <b>will define</b> the <b>attacks</b>,
                    <b>strengths</b>, and <b>weaknesses</b> of your character.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>There are more games that I was inspired by but these three are the most, and these will be the base for <b>Mech-Geon</b>'s base. The idea
                    is have a <b> solid base of Turn-based rpg</b> core with <b>roguelike elements</b> like <b>procedural</b> <b>maps</b>, 
                    <b>weapons</b>, <b>objects</b> and <b>enemies</b>. Also mix different genres
                    in other ways, for example, one level has <b>grid based movements</b>, but then in the lobby, the player will use controls like a <b>top down shooter</b>.
