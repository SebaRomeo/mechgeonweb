                <p>
                    I took this action from <b>Divinity</b>, the idea is set your character in an <b>alert state</b>, 
                    if an <b>enemy</b> moves into your <b>attack range</b> your character will <b>attack him automatically</b>.
                    In this case I set the corner of the board as the target location to watch but in the future this will depend on the character range
                </p>

                <p><i>Node states</i></span>
                <p>
                    Each <b>node</b> is able to contain more than one <b>state</b>, for example: <b>fire, electricity, water</b>, etc... (these are examples, they may not be in the final game),
                    if the player walk throught a node with a state set, the effects of that state will be applied to the node, <b>if the state is fire, the player will receive fire damage</b>.
                    In this video the is no visual feedback but you can see that the player is destroyed for taking to much damage from the node.
                </p>

                <p><i>Fog of war update</i></span>
                <p>
                    Now if the player tries to move to a node <b>where there is another character</b> but the player doesn't know it because that node is out of his vision range, <b>his character will stop</b>
                    when the node is inside the fog of war.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These were the main updates so far. I also implemented a <b>stats system</b> for the actions, each action will <b>consume an amount of some resource</b> (<b>stamina, energy</b>, etc...).
                    Those resources can be defined by the <b>stats system</b> but is in an early stage and because of that I didn't include it in the report.
